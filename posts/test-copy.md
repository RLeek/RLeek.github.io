# Behavioral Patterns

Once you've built your game's set and festooned it with actors and props, all
that remains is to start the scene. For this, you need behavior -- the
screenplay that tells each entity in your game what to do.

Of course all code is "behavior", and all software is defining behavior, but
what's different about games is often the *breadth* of it that you have to
implement. While your word processor may have a long list of features, it pales
in comparison with the number of inhabitants, items, and quests in your average
role-playing game.

The patterns in this chapter help to quickly define and refine a large quantity of
maintainable behavior. Type Objects create
categories of behavior without the rigidity of defining an actual class. A 
Subclass Sandbox gives you a safe set of primitives
you can use to define a variety of behaviors. The most advanced option is
Bytecode, which moves behavior out of code entirely and into
data.
