<h1>Behavioral Patterns</h1>
<p>Once you've built your game's set and festooned it with actors and props, all
that remains is to start the scene. For this, you need behavior -- the
screenplay that tells each entity in your game what to do.</p>
<p>Of course all code is "behavior", and all software is defining behavior, but
what's different about games is often the <em>breadth</em> of it that you have to
implement. While your word processor may have a long list of features, it pales
in comparison with the number of inhabitants, items, and quests in your average
role-playing game.</p>
<p>The patterns in this chapter help to quickly define and refine a large quantity of
maintainable behavior. Type Objects create
categories of behavior without the rigidity of defining an actual class. A 
Subclass Sandbox gives you a safe set of primitives
you can use to define a variety of behaviors. The most advanced option is
Bytecode, which moves behavior out of code entirely and into
data.</p>
